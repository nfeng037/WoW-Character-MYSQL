Thanks to the help of brave heroes, House Proudmoore has been restored and Kul Tiras is poised to fight alongside the valiant Alliance once more.",Alliance,https://blz-contentstack-images.akamaized.net/v3/assets/blt3452e3b114fab0cd/blta145dfe5b0e77cf7/6165ecb00e274669d2eec004/VRV4QPLLVYV91549479456219.png

34,Dark Iron Dwarf,"Known for their fiery tempers and fierce determination, Dark Iron dwarves have a turbulent history with the other clans. A failed coup in Ironforge ignited the War of the Three Hammers, and many of the Dark Iron once fought in the service of Ragnaros the Firelord. Though one faction of the dwarves is pledged to Queen-Regent Moira Thaurissan, others refuse to stand alongside their kin.

37,Mechagnome,"Long ago, a faction of zealous gnomes set out on a quest to improve their bodies and minds. Settling on the isolated isle of Mechagon, they experimented with ancient technology to reverse the Curse of Flesh and become living machines.

2,Orc,"The orcs once lived as shamanic clans on the lush world of Draenor. Corrupted by Kil’jaeden, a demon lord of the Burning Legion, they invaded the world of Azeroth.

5,Undead,"Death offered no escape for the scores of humans killed during the Lich King’s campaign to scour the living from Lordaeron.

Calling themselves Forsaken, they now struggle to thrive in a world that has come to despise their existence.",Horde,https://blz-contentstack-images.akamaized.net/v3/assets/blt3452e3b114fab0cd/blt0b1f2cd145aedbcd/6165f001a3e18902e03811d3/4UX5EM1CFKV81613677292421.png

10,Blood Elf,"For thousands of years, the high elves of Quel'Thalas drew strength from the Sunwell, a magical font of arcane energies. An invasion by the undead Scourge decimated the kingdom's population and deprived them of the Sunwell's might. Taking the name blood elves – or sin’dorei in their own tongue –the people of Quel’Thalas sated their magical thirst for a time with demonic fel energies. Once the Sunwell was restored, the blood elves worked to rebuild their homeland and help lead the Horde into a bold future.",Horde,https://blz-contentstack-images.akamaized.net/v3/assets/blt3452e3b114fab0cd/blt0ef3a9577fa8e9b2/6165d76b25b12a4a14b3a758/0FP7U3NPCZYF1552513934895.png
6,Tauren,"The peaceful tauren—known in their own tongue as the shu’halo—have long dwelled in Kalimdor, striving to preserve the balance of nature at the behest of their goddess, the Earth Mother.

By returning stability to Zandalar, the heroes of the Horde can gain a powerful new ally.

9,Goblin,"The goblins’ craftiness and greed make them masters of mercantilism. Reforging old pacts with their one-time allies, the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel have been welcomed into the Horde. Honing their inherent cunning to a razor’s edge, the goblins hope to use their explosive inventions to rule the world – or at the very least own a profitable percentage of it.",Horde,https://blz-contentstack-images.akamaized.net/v3/assets/blt3452e3b114fab0cd/blte86b6ed1f29656b9/6165e7dedfd0436b6dcf6e2e/YAAFZMAKCVPG1613677288954.png

27,Nightborne,"Isolated behind a protective barrier for 10,000 years, the elves of Suramar grew increasingly dependent upon the arcane magic of the Nightwell.

36,Mag'har Orc,"For untold generations, the orc clans of Draenor battled one another in endless war. But when Gul'dan offered them the blood of his demonic masters, the disparate tribes of Mag'har—the orcish word for ""uncorrupted""—refused the dark bargain and banded together to drive out the Burning Legion.
